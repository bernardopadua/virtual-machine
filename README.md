# Virtual Machine
It's a very simple virtual machine with basic operations. It works as a page application to interact with virtual arbitrary data.
The virtual machine is just at the beggining point with the client-side only. Next goal is to build a server in golang to interconnect with other virtual machines.

And all this for learning and fun! :)

## TO-DO

+ Client-Side
  + Open files;
  + Module to communicate via HTTP;
+ Server-Side
  + Build it from the scratch;

## Technologies

+ Babel (ES2015);
  + Transform Class (Static classes);
+ React JS;
+ WebPack;

## Install

In the repository the main 'js' is already transformed. If something changes you will have to install NodeJs with NPM modules.

To install all the modules:
>npm install

To pack and transform the code:
>npm run pack

Any question, just let me know! :)
